"""
PyCharm already comes with a lot of other modules. It is possible to get external modules developed by other people. 
Just need to Google them. Once I find one I like, I just need to open the PyCharm Terminal and type:

pip install MODULE_NAME

Then I can use it easily with the import function

If I want to uninstall a module I just need to type:

pip uninstall MODULE_NAME
